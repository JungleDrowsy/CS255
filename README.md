System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is an enterprise focused on driver's education. They aimed to transition online with a cloud-driven web platform to provide resources like practice tests and a feature to schedule driving lessons.

What did you do particularly well?

One of the core aspects of system design is translating the client's vision into a coherent blueprint that can be turned into a working software. This translation process mirrors converting one language into another. My strength lies in dissecting a problem into comprehensible segments, so I don't need to rely on memory but rather a deep understanding of its workings.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

My area for improvement would be in creating diagrams. By nature, I prefer hands-on work over planning, though I do recognize the significance of diagramming in streamlining software development and minimizing errors. Effective diagrams act as a guideline, preventing on-the-spot adjustments.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

A design's efficacy is measured by how well it caters to the user's or client's requirements. Hence, maintaining open communication lines between the developer and client is crucial to ensure that the software aligns perfectly with the user's expectations and demands.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When faced with multifaceted projects, I adopt a reverse engineering approach. It's like writing an essay; starting can be daunting. To navigate this, I focus on the aspects I'm most certain about. Taking DriverPass as an example, I knew users needed to log in. So, I started with designing the login mechanism, then incorporated relevant features like user verification and error messages for incorrect inputs. Gradually, I'd branch out from this core, addressing each component until the entire scope is covered.
